# BACKGROUND OVERLAY
The background is generated by Brieuc an is costly to generate
'/eos/experiment/fcc/users/b/brfranco/background_files/guineaPig_andrea_June2024_v23_vtx000/'
So the same background file will be used for multiple events 
each file has 1 event

The 'run_sequence_background_sim.sh' precalculates the input of the overlay for all background events and then each physics event uses one from the available selection, so some background files are used for multiple events

## OVERLAY
The second script 'run_sequence_CLD_train_tau.sh':
- creates the pythia events
- uses ddsim for the detector sim 
- overlais with the mix of background events
- runs the CLD reco 
- stores a flat tree for training where the overlaid hits from the background are flagged with the 'isoverlay' (scripts: make_pf_tree_clic_bindings.py/ tree_tools.py)
